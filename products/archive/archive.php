      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="style1"> </span>Drawmer products are built to the highest standards and so it's not unusual to find our older products that are still in use even though they were originally sold thirty years ago. Here you will find information and operator's manuals for products that we no longer manufacture.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><span class="style6"><span class="style5"><a name="dsl424" id="dsl424"></a>DSL424 <span class="style5BLUE">- TwoPlusTwo Dynamics</span></span></span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>  <span class="style1">The DSL424 provides the engineer with a 1U four channel comprehensive toolbox capable of solving the most complex dynamic problems.</span> Incorporated in the 1U package are two industry standard frequency conscious noise gates and two soft/hard knee compressors with variable threshold limiting. The channels may be front panel configured as four individual stand alone processors, a stereo linked pair of comp/limiters with a stereo linked pair of gates. Alternatively, any combination of processing can be achieved by rear panel patching.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The DSL424 combines the gates of the DS404 with the compressor/limiters of the DL441 to provide a versatile 1U problem solver invaluable in applications where rack space is limited.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Recognizing that there are many general applications which require equipment that is simple to operate, Drawmer have designed the noise gate stages of the DSL424 utilizing &lsquo;Programme Adaptive&rsquo; circuitry. This makes the DSL424 ideally suited for use over a wide range of input signals, ranging from drums and other percussive instruments through to vocals, pianos and even complete mixes.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The provision of variable Low-Pass and High-Pass Filters allows &lsquo;without compromise&rsquo; frequency selective gating with a KEY LISTEN facility enabling monitoring of the filter setting. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Each gate channel can be operated as HARD - offering ultra-fast response time, stable triggering and a specialized release contour which is ideally suited to percussive material or SOFT - a versatile Expander capable of handling vocals and sub mixes.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Noise Gate</strong><br />
      <p>Variable High/Low Pass Filters for frequency triggering.<br />
      <p>Auto attack.<br />
      <p>Variable release.<br />

      <p>Key Listen facility.<br />
      <p>Slave linking.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>The compressor section</strong> features a highly developed, auto attack/release system which adapts itself to the programme material being processed and is equally effective on individual sounds or complex mixes.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>To maximise flexibility, each channel of the DSL424 is switchable between traditional ratio (hard knee) and soft-knee operation. Traditionally, soft-knee compressors are preferable for unobtrusive level control or for the control of finished mixes, whereas ratio type compressors are generally considered more successful in creative applications or where large amounts of gain reduction are required. By offering a choice of both modes, the DSL424 is capable of outstanding results in a very wide range of studio and live sound situations. The two channels may be operated independently or linked for true stereo operation.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Also included in each channel of the DSL424 is a peak limiter which allows the user to set an absolute output signal level that will not be exceeded. If the peak limiter threshold is exceeded for more than a few milliseconds, additional gain reduction will be applied to reduce the overall signal level to within accepted limits without distortion. Once the peak has passed, the system gain will return to normal after a period of about one second. This facility is extremely valuable both in live sound applications, for driver protection, and in digital recording where an absolute maximum recording level exists. Furthermore, when deliberately overdriven, it can be used creatively to produce level &ldquo;pumping&rdquo; effects which can be useful on electric guitar or rock vocal sounds.</p>

       <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="style1"> </span>The benefits of multi-band processing, with the ability to apply different parameters to different sections of the audio bandwidth have been apparent to sound engineers for quite some time. However, &lsquo;locking in&rsquo; your audio to any one specific multi-band unit can vastly reduce the creative options. The desired combination of processing to deal with low frequency energy, the vocal mid range and high frequency detail and enhancement is not necessarily available from any one manufacturer.</p>
      <p>The new Drawmer THREE-SUM opens up a whole new set of options allowing the engineer to split the audio into two or three bands and apply his or her own sonic signature to each part of the audio bandwidth. The THREE-SUM employs a high quality signal path culminating in a variable threshold, brick wall limiter section with bypass facility. To ensure transparency the limiter design is &lsquo;two stage&rsquo;, applying different processing to the H.F. content of the material. In applications where the dynamics of the material need to be retained to create an open sound, the limiter is essential for catching peaks.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The THREE-SUM has been designed for use in high-end mastering and general recording applications, alternatively, it can transform a project studio, equipped only with &lsquo;single band&rsquo; processors, into a serious multi-band facility.</p>

             <p><span class="style5"><a name="mclock" id="mclock"></a>M-Clock <span class="style5BLUE">- Master Clock Generator and Multiple Sample Rate Converter</span></span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In today's studio where increasing numbers of digital devices need to be interconnected, maintaining digital signal integrity can be a serious problem. The traditional professional solution has been to use an expensive master clock that drives all the digital equipment in the studio, but in many different types of studios there are often pieces of equipment that don't have wordclock inputs such as consumer CD players, MD recorders, DAT machines and budget computer soundcards.
      <p>Drawmer's unique solution to this dilemma is the M-Clock, an affordable yet extremely highly specified, multiple output master clock generator that also incorporates four further channels of sample-rate-conversion, all locked to the same master clock. There are also alternative sync outputs for those pieces of equipment without wordclock connections that can be sync'ed via their digital audio inputs using a 'black' signal carrying no audio information.</p>
      <p>The advantages of combining wordclock with multiple channels of 'clock-locked' sample rate conversion are significant and often under-appreciated. With M-Clock, all your 'pro' and consumer digital equipment can run in the same system, locked to the same clock, with no worries about finding a suitable sync source. You'll find you're no longer having to switch equipment between internal and external sync as you repatch - and the M-Clock's  ultra-precision, low-jitter clock helps maintain optimum stereo imaging, lower noise and lower distortion. If you have multiple pieces of digital equipment in your studio, whether professional or a mixture of professional and consumer, M-Clock is probably the most effective upgrade you can make for anything like the price.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The M-clock has since been replaced by the <a href="../dms/m-clock-plus-master-clock-src.php">M-Clock Plus</a> and <a href="../dms/m-clock-lite-aes-grade-1-master-clock.php">M-Clock Lite.</a></p>

      <p>The one-rackspace TS1 features Class-A Drawmer preamps and a stereo soft-knee Drawmer tube compressor, coupled with a 24-bit/96k digital converter. Usable either as a stand-alone stereo-tube compressor or as a dedicated voice or instrument channel preamp/compressor, the TS1 features a HF contour control and variable highpass filter on the inputs, and a variable Tube Drive control for adding tube saturation. Additional features include balanced analog I/Os, phantom power, an effects insert point and compressor sidechain. A optional digital-output module adds S/PDIF or AES/EBU at up to 24-bit resolution and 96kHz sample rate.<p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The MasterFlow DC2476 is a state of the art digital mastering processor drawing on Drawmer's considerable experience in analogue signal processing and offering un-parallelled power and flexibility at sample rates from 32kHz to 96kHz.
      <p>All the key functions are modelled on classic analogue signal processors with the added benefits which digital processing allows.<br />
        Signal processing functions are as follows:-</p>
      <p> Input Level adjustment and stereo balance.<br />
        Dynamic Equaliser.<br />
        Full band Bootstrap Compressor/Expander.<br />
        5 band parametric Analogue modelled Equaliser with selectable Bell/Shelf filters for Bass and Treble bands.<br />
        3 Band Expander.<br />
        3 Band Bootstrap Compressor.<br />
        3 Band limiter and 3 Band Stereo Width.<br />
        3 Band Tube Saturation.<br />
        3 band output level control. Auto Fade with selectable fade shape and Rounding to 16,18,20,24 bit using 4 selectable dither shapes. </p>
      <p>Although a wide range of manual control is available, all Expanders and Compressors are programme adaptive, taking account of the dynamics of the signal being processed. Since the object of a Mastering processor is to push the signal as close to full scale as possible and increase the overall loudness and spectral detail, any overload, anywhere in the system must be prevented. This is accomplished by a Gain Management system which monitors signals throughout processing and reducing levels when overloads could occur.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Most 24 bit A - D converters are hard pushed to give 19 bit resolution - the other five bits are essentially marketing bits. However, by using out proprietary Multiple Converter Technology, we have produced a 24 bit A - D conversion package with a massive 130dB dynamic range and extremely low distortion. With built-in sample rate conversion, the DC2496 can output signals at 44.1, 48, 88.2 or 96KHz sample rates while implementing bit-rate reduction using one of the best sounding dithering strategies available anywhere. A high quality D - A convertor is included for accurate monitoring of the digital signal and the facility is included to enable true 24 bit/96KHz audio to be recorded in stereo using six tracks of an ADAT, DA88 (or other multitrack recorder using a compatible interface). These recordings may then be played back via the DC2496 to reconstitute the original 24 bit, 96KHz signal. An additional 16/20 bit 44.1K/48K In/Out is provided to record a simultaneous back-up.
      <p> Proprietary ‘Multiple Converter Technology' giving a true 130dB dynamic range at 24 bit, 96KHz.<br />
        AES/EBU, SPDIF, TDIF and ADAT interfacing.<br />

      <p><span class="style5"><a name="df330" id="df330"></a>DF330 <span class="style5BLUE">- Universal Noise Filter</span></span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The Drawmer DF330 is a single ended noise reduction system which does not require any previous encoding. Instead, it uses a dynamic filter which senses the highest frequency of incoming program material and opens a filter to that frequency. It has been designed to dramatically reduce noise, regardless of source, in a wide variety of recording/broadcast situations. An example of this is when old recordings are remastered for CD. Some other applications would include: Analogue to digital mastering, reducing tape hiss and noise resulting from high gain and high frequency boost on mixing consoles. Restoring degraded or poorly recorded material for tape duplication and resolving problems with noisy synthesizers, guitar amplifiers, effects units etc.
      
      <p>The main features of the Drawmer DF330 include:</p>
      <p> Excellent visual displays are provided. The input level is displayed with a 3 colour 'traffic light' style LED meter. The filter cut-off frequency display has nine LED segments and the expander gain reduction has a five segment LED display. Further to this there are LED's to show bypass, stereo link status and power input<br />
        A 50Hz 'rumble' filter with a slope of 18dB per octave is available independently on both channels<br />
        In addition to a full system bypass, the expander and filter can be switched out of the audio path separately, enabling easy comparisons to be made. under all conditions<br />
        A comprehensive expander with automatic attack time, variable release and switchable ratio and attenuation gives up to 40dB reduction in overall noise during silent passages<br />
        Stereo linking allows both channels to track identically. This prevents image shifting with stereo programme, and phase shifts when both channels are mixed into mono<br />
        The dynamic filter has two modes of operation. In the manual mode, the threshold is adjusted by the user to give optimum results. In the Auto mode the unit is capable of tracking the signal level thereby enabling the filter to continue to operate successfully during fade ups and downs. This makes manual adjustment unnecessary<br />
        Simultaneous -10dBu unbalanced 1/4 inch jack and +4dBu balanced XLR inputs and outputs allows the unit to be used as a level converting interface between the two operating levels, e.g. The output from a cassette machine at -10dBu could give a balanced +4dBu output and -10dBu output</p>

      <p><span class="style5"><a name="e101" id="e101"></a>E101 <span class="style5BLUE">- Passive E.Q.</span></span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The Drawmer E101 was a four stage, single channel passive equaliser, followed by a stage of makeup gain to make up for the insertion loss of passive circuitry. Traditional Inductor/ Capacitor/ Resistor circuits are employed in the filter design and a very low noise, solid state amplifier is used to provide the necessary gain. This in our view, gave the best of both worlds; the smoothness of purely passive filtering combined with the low noise, low distortion amplification which can only be accomplished using recent technology. The format of the Drawmer E101 offered a high degree of control at the extreme of the audio spectrum, where precise correction or subtlle enhancement is often necessary.
      <p>Because the Drawmer E101 used a passive equaliser circuit, seperate filter sections were provided for cut and boost. This had the advantage of allowing the user to simultaneously add cut and boost at different frequencies. With all the cut and boost controls set to flat (fully anti-clockwise), the equaliser had unity gain.</p>
      <p>There are four equaliser sections, two for the bass end of the audio spectrum and two for the treble. Frequancy selection is by means of stepped rotary switches while the cut and boost controls are continuously variable.</p>
      <p> BYPASS switches the EQ and make-up gain amplifier out of circuit.</p>
      <p> BASS CUT The Bass Cut section employs a shelving Hi-pass filter which may be switched to operate at : 20Hz, 30Hz, 60Hz, or 100Hz. Up to 15dB of cut may be applied and this section is useful for attenuating frequencies below the useful range of the programme being processed or for reducing overall boominess.</p>
      <p> BASS BOOST Switched to operate at : 20Hz, 30Hz, 60Hz, or 100Hz., the bass boost section offers a choice of Hi-pass shelving or peaking characteristics. In 'Peak' mode the 'Q' of the filter is 2.5, and the maximum boost is 16dB. In 'Shelf' mode the maximum boost is 13.5dB.</p>
      <p> TREBLE BOOST the Treble Boost section comprises a variable 'Q' peaking filter operatring at frequencies of 3KHz, 4KHz, 5KHz, 10KHz, and 16KHz. The bandwith control allows adjustment of 'Q' over the range 0.8 to 2.1. Up to 12 dB of boost may be applied at the minimum 'Q' setting, and up to 18dB of boost are available at the maximum'Q' setting.</p>
      <p> TREBLE CUT This section has a shelving Lo-pass characteristic and may be switched to operate at 5KHz, 10 KHZ or 20KHz. A maximum of 18dB of cut may be applied. Apart from its tonal applications, this section is useful for attenuating frequencies above the natural range of the programme being equalised which will also serve to attenuate any high frequency noise present in the source programme.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The Drawmer DL221 was a dual channel hard knee compressor with limiter. The Drawmer DL231 was a balanced version of the Drawmer DL221 with an expander.
      <p>The Expander had variable threshold from +10dB to -40dB. Three switched ratio settings of 1:2, 1:5 and 1:20. Three switched attenuation levels of -10dB, -20dB and -40dB. Expander metering was the 'traffic light' style as used in the DS201 noise gate.</p>
      <p>The compressor section had threshold down to -24dB, ratio of 1:1 to 20:1, attack of 50mS to 5 seconds, release of 50mS to 5 seconds and gain of -20dB to +20dB. A ten element universal meter could be switched to show VU or GR.</p>
      <p>The limiter section was selectable by a toggle switch. It had a fixed level of +6dB (+10dBU). A single red light showed limiting action.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The first Drawmer product, very rare and highly prized. Prospective purchasers should check that the unit is in good working order. Restoration or repair could prove very expensive.
      
      <p>The Drawmer DMT 1080 contains two independant delay lines. A multi section delay having a maximum delay time of 80mS, has taps at 10mS, 30mS, 50mS and 80 mS which are fed to either channel 1 or channel 2 by the touch button selectors. The same tap on both channels produces a mono output whilst different taps produce stereo images. Chorus on either channel produces two delays, each of which is differant from the main 10,30,50,80mS delays and the two chorus delays on the other channel; so chorus on both channelsgives a stereo image.</p>
      <p>The output from an auxilliary 10mS delay is fed via the 'Phase' level control to both channels giving a mono image. A clean feed signal is connected in a similar manner via the 'Feedthrough' level control.</p>
      <p>Delay time is variable over a 30:1 ratio either manually ('Manual Delay') or automatically using the internal low frequency oscillator which runs at 0.05Hz to 15Hz.</p>
      <p>Control Voltages for each delay line are in anti-phasei.e. when the main delay is at maximum, the 'Phase' delay is at minimum and vice versa. This means that true phasing can occur at several points in the sweep (from min to max delay) as each main delay tap in turn cancels the signal from the auxilliary delay.</p>
      <p>Outputs from the main delay taps are of fixed level. They are mixed with the variable 'Phase' and 'Feedthrough' signals before the output level controls. + or - signals from channel 1 can be routed back via the feedback control to the delay line inputs. +feedback produces resonant peaks at short delays whilst - feedback gives a notch filter type of response.</p>
